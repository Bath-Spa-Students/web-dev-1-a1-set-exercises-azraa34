            <p>Set in 1960s France, Dead Plate follows the story of Rody, a young man hired to work at a fancy bistro by the stoic but charismatic chef named Vince.

However, as the days go on, Rody starts having violent dreams and becomes suspicious of his boss and the food served at the bistro.</p>
